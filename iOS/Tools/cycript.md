# Cycript
[Cycript](http://www.cycript.org/) allows developers to explore and modify running applications on either iOS or Mac OS X 
using a hybrid of Objective-C++ and JavaScript syntax through an interactive console that features syntax highlighting and tab completion.
(It also runs standalone on Android and Linux and provides access to Java, but without injection.) It can be installed via Cydia.
