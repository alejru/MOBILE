# Install an App
### Cydia Impactor
Requires Apple developer account. Im my experiance this is the best method. 

### iPA Installer
AppSync Unified patches installd allowing you to install unsigned IPA files on iOS. AppSync can be used to clone installed apps, download fakesigned IPAs, and also to assist in the development of iOS apps using Xcode. Unlike Cydia Impactor there is no 3 app limit per device or 7-day certificate. Install AppSync Unified and forget about certificate revokes, not working apps, faded icons, etc. Also, apps installed from 3rd party App Stores should work.
* Install  IPA Installer using Cydia. 
* Install [AppSync Unified](https://kubadownload.com/news/appsync-unified/) from Cydia.
* Install Filza File Manager. 
* Find the .ipa file using Filza. Click it and "Install"
